# shadoplan
A very handy program that handles tasks the simplest but just as reasonable way

### Concepts
* [X] Will be written in C, will be patchable and will have a config.h file
* [ ] Will handle adding new tasks quickly (will ask for type of TODO; option to do via direct typing into command or run command then prompt for it)
* [ ] Can make new TODO direcories? def new topics
* [ ] Store completed TODO's with date, in separate file
